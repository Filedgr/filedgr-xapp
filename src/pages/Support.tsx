            Why is my NFT's artwork not being displayed?
          </h3>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            This could be due to (i) a slow connection, or (ii) the viewer is
            unable to read the metadata (referencing where the NFT asset is
            stored).
          </p>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            If you can view the NFT details and attributes in the viewer, then
            the error is most likely due to a slow connection where the network
            times out. This error occurs most frequently when using a public
            IPFS link. Please try again by quitting the xApp and reload.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.question}>
            What XLS20 artwork metadata does this xApp support?
          </h3>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            For XLS20 NFTs, our xApp is compatible with XLS24d metadata
            standards. If your XLS20 NFT artwork is not displayed, we advise you
            to request support from the Token Issuer and/or service used to
            acquire the NFT.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.question}>What features are being added next?</h3>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            The Filedgr Web3 API for developers and business use cases, are next
            on our roadmap. Please suggest any other features you would like to
            see by getting in contact with us. Please follow us via Twitter and
            our website for updates, airdrop news and product releases.
